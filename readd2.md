## ***CSS INTRODUCTION***


#### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

#### Selctor{declariton} : declarations sit inside curly brackets and each made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.

### *USING EXTERNAL CSS :*

#### < link> : inside the head tag, to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page.


### ***link tag should use three attributes:***

- href : it specifies the path to the CSS file
- type: specifies the type of document being linked to.
- rel:  specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. 

### ***USING INTERNAL CSS:*** < style> tag inside the head

***
## ***BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS***


### script: 

it is series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. and to write a script you need to set your goals and a list of tasks you need to accomplish, define the goal, design the script (flow chart), code each step. each task may be broken into many steps, and everything you wrote or design in you in your flow chart needs to be written in a language that the computer can understand.

### VARIABLES: 


### Declaring: creating a variable and giving it a name

var quantity;


**ASSING VARIBLE TO A VALUE:** to tell what information you like to store in it.


var quantity = 6;

**OPPERATORS:**  they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

***arithmetic operators:***

addition + , subtraction - , division / , multiplication * , modules %. 

***string operator :***

( +) is the only string operator, and it is used to join two or more strings to create a single value.
***
## ***DECISIONS AND LOOPS***

comparison operators usually return values of true or false.

1. == equal to: compares two values to see if they are the same 

2. != not equal to: compare two values to see if they are not the sams.

3. === strict equal to: checks both value and data type is the same

4. !== strict not equal to: checks both the value and the data type is not the same

5.  (>)greater than 

6. < less than 

7. (>=) greater than or equal to

8. <= less than or equal to 

#### logical operators allow you to compare the results more than one.

1. && logical and: test more than one condition 

2. || logical or: test at least one condition 

3. ! logical not: takes a single boolean value and inverts it 

#### loops check a condition and there is three types:

1. for: if you need to run a code specific number of time 

2. while: if you don't know how many times you want to run the code

3. do while: it will always run the condition inside the curly brackets 

loop counters: its made of three statements initialization, condition, and update.
