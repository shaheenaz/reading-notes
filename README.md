# GROWTH MINDSET
### Do you love learning? Do you think that intelligence and talent are simply good starting points to success? 
### Do you believe in NO PAIN NO GAIN?
#### If yes, then you have a *Growth Mindset* and now you may wonder if there's another type of mindsets.
##### Well, theres is two type of people, ones with a *growth mindset*and the others is *fixed mindset*.
### Growth Mindset:when people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard workâ€”brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.
### Fixed Mindset:when people who see their qualities as fixed traits that cannot change. Those who hold a fixed mindset believe that they are either good or bad at something based on their inherent nature.
