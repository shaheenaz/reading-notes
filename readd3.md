1. border-width to control the width of the border

MARGIN:  controls the gap between boxes

text-align to center an elemnt

display: to turn an inline elemnt into a block


## SWITCH


A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. switch(the vaiable){condition}


#### truthy and falsy values


falsy: false, 0 , ' ' ,  variable with no value assigned to it 

truthy: true, 1 , 'conent' , number calculations 

loops check a condition and there is three types:

1. for: if you need to run a code specific number of time 

2. while: if you don't know how many times you want to run the code

3. do while: it will always run the condition inside the curly brackets 

## ARRAYS


An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

each value is separated by a comma. var name =['elment1', 'elemnt2', ]  valuese can be added at the same line or seprate lines.
