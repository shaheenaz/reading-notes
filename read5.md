### **comparison operators usually return values of true or false.


1- == equal to: compares two values to see if they are the same 

2- != not equal to: compare two values to see if they are not the sams.

3- === strict equal to: checks both value and data type is the same

4- !== strict not equal to: checks both the value and the data type is not the same

5- > greater than 

6- < less than 

7- >= greater than or equal to

8- <= less than or equal to 

### ***logical operators allow you to compare the results more than one.

1- && logical and: test more than one condition 

2-|| logical or: test at least one condition 

3-! logical not: takes a single boolean value and inverts it 

### ***loops check a condition and there is three types:

1- for: if you need to run a code specific number of time 

2- while: if you don't know how many times you want to run the code

3- do while: it will always run the condition inside the curly brackets 

### ****loop counters: its made of three statements initialization, condition, and update.
