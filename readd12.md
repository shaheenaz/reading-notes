## charts


its a better way to show data rather than tables


first we need to download charts.js then we need to crate canvas element in our html

to draw a pie or bar chart we must set the canvas elemnt then we need to get the context and to instantiate the chart then we can create the data

basic use of canvas


its like img elemnt but have no src insted it have width and height and we can provide a text conent ,unlike img tag ,canvas needs closing tag

to render canvas element use getContext()



## Drawing shapes with canvas

rectangles:

fillRect(x, y, width, height)Draws a filled rectangle.

strokeRect(x, y, width, height)Draws a rectangular outline.

clearRect(x, y, width, height)Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.

drawing path :

beginPath(),Path methods,closePath()



## Drawing text

The text is filled using the :Â fillStyle.

The text is strockefusing the current strokeStyle.

## Styling text :

font = value

textAlign = value

textBaseline = value


direction = value
