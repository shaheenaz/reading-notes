## LAYOUT

- the normal flow for the CSS h block-level element sits on top of the next one.

- relative position: moves an element from where it normally located.

- position absolute: When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page

- fixed position: its like the absolute position but requires a property.

- float: to place an element far to the left or right.

- clear: used to tell that no elemnet should touch the lift or the right side of the box.

- to overlap elements we use z-index

- The liquid layout: uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.
- using a CSS framworkks saves you from repeating the same tasks and tests across different browsers, but it may ask you to use class name written in in html.
- we can use @import to use outer fonts like google fonts .
