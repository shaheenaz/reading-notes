software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

here are my points for psychological safety:

1. the key how teammates treat each other

2. everyone should have the chance to talk

3. know when theothersare feeling upset of left out 

4. dont speak over one another and focus on the main thing

5. knowing the role of each teammate

6. The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.

7. share the things that scare us and about insecurities in constructive way

8. listen to each other
