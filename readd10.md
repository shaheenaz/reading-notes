## the stack:


javascript process line by line but when function is needed it stacks the new function on top of the current task

there are two phases of exeution context:

1. PREPARE 
• The new scope is created 
• Variables, functions, and arguments are created 
• The value of the this keyword is determined

2. EXECUTE 
• Now it can assign values to variables 
• Reference functions and run their code 
• Execute statements 

there are many errors types: name, message, fileNumber,lineNmber

to deal with errors you need to debug the scirpt and handle errors using try catch finally staments 

there are common errors like : missing or adding charachters or data type issues

if you stuck at javascript you can try those debugging methods:

1. use another browser 

2. add numbers 

3. explain the code to someone else

4. search at stack overflow

try: you put in it the code and it must br follow by catch or finally 

catch:it steps altenative set of code

finally: will run the code either way even if it failed.
