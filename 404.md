object : its like real life object that have state and behavior and object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages). its benfits by its :


Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects.
Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program.
Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement.
