1. What is OAuth?open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes 2.  how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential
3. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like. like going to any website anf give you options to sign in using facebook or google
4. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user? The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).The user gives the approved access token to the first website.The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
1. What is OpenID? OpenID is for humans logging into machines
2. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.
3. What is Authorization Code Flow? exchanges an Authorization Code for a token.
4. What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?When public clients request Access Tokens, some additional security concerns are posed that are not mitigated by the Authorization Code Flow alone
5. What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?you obtain an ID token using authorization code flow performed by the app backend.
6. What is Client Credentials Flow?M2M apps use the Client Credentials Flow which they pass along their Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate themselves and get a token.
7. What is Device Authorization Flow?which they pass along their Client ID to initiate the authorization process and get a token.
What is Resource Owner Password Flow? requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form.
