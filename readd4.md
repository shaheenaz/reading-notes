## LINKS


TO write a link we use < a> element and we can link a specofic page by using href attribute.

to put an email link use malito after the href attribute

to open the link in new tap use target after the url

## LAYOUT


- the normal flow for the CSS h block-level element sits on top of the next one.


- relative position: moves an element from where it normally located.


- position absolute: When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page


- fixed position: its like the absolute position but requires a property.

- float: to place an element far to the left or right.


- clear: used to tell that no elemnet should touch the lift or the right side of the box.


## FUNCTIONS


Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function.


- FUNCTION DECLAIR: function function name (){ the code block} 

- CALLING A FUNCTION: finction name();

to get a single value from a function some functions returns information forthe code that called them.
